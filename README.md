== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.2.3

* Deployment instructions
 - Clone down repo and clone down github.com/eaud/animal-api
 - Change the API url in `app/controllers/animals_controller` to the local host port that you're running the api on (or leave as is to run with heroku API @ animal-api.herokuapp.com)



Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
